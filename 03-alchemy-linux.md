# Automated baremetal tasks

[Alchemy Linux](http://shopify.github.io/alchemy-linux-public/) lets you automate tasks on servers with no OS.

It is designed to be PXE booted, runs entirely in ram, and is extremely easy to customize - use it as a Swiss Army Knife!

Check out the [Alchemy Linux](http://shopify.github.io/alchemy-linux-public/) site for more details.
