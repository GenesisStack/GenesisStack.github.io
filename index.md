# It all starts here

The Genesis Stack is made up of 3 core components

+ Collins - the central source of truth
+ Alchemy Transmuter - control boot sequences and automate baremetal server actions.
+ Alchemy Linux - direct control over servers without any OS

Together, these components will help you

+ Perform server intake, burn-in, and provisioning
+ Track important information about your infrastructure in a central, easily accessible location
+ Collect important state, hardware, and connectivity information
+ Automate repetitive tasks, and eliminate human error.

On the sidebar you'll find links to each of these components, including examples, and instructions on how to deploy them.
