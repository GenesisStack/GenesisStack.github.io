# Automated decision making

The [Alchemy Transmuter](http://shopify.github.io/alchemy-transmuter-public/) enables you to control how servers boot.

Beyond that, it acts as an interface between the server and Collins, and can be used to automate almost anything you want to do.

Check out the [Alchemy Transmuter](http://shopify.github.io/alchemy-transmuter-public/) site for more details.
